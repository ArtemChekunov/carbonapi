**0.12.0**
 - Add support for Prometheus as Backend. This allows to use Prometheus-compatible software as carbonapi's backends (e.x. Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics)
 - Add support for querying msgpack-compatible backends. This should make carbonapi compatible with graphite-web 1.1 and [grafana/metrictank](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank)
 - **[Breaking][Code]** Migrate all internal structures to `github.com/go-graphite/protocol/carbonapi_v3_pb`. This removes redundant IsAbsent slice and changes all timestamps to int64 (they are still expected to have uint32 timestamps there)
 - **[Breaking][Improvement]** Integrate carbonzipper 1.0.0. This introduces better loadbalancing support, but significantly changes config file format. It might behave differently with the same settings. It also removes carbonzipper dependency.
 - [Improvement] seriesByTag Support (thx. to Vladimir Kolobaev)
 - [Improvement] aliasByTag Support (thx. to Vladimir Kolobaev)
 - [Improvement] Added support for more aggregation functions (thx. to Oleg Matrokhin)
 - [Improvement] Add 'aggregate' function.
 - [Improvement] pixelRatio for png render (thx. to Roman Lomonosov)
 - [Fix] Supported functions were updated to be more compatible with graphtie-web 1.1.0+
 - [Fix] fix movingXyz error on intervals greater than 30 days (thx. to Safronov Michail)
 - [Fix] Fix timeShift function (thx. to Gunnar Þór Magnússon)

**0.12.0-rc.1**
 - Fix panic when using Prometheus backend and query /tags/autoComplete/tags without parameters
 - Fix long going issue with stuck requests towards backend.

**0.12.0-rc.0**
 - Add experimental support for Prometheus as Backend.
 - Add experimental support for querying msgpack-compatible backends. This should make carbonapi compatible with graphite-web 1.1 and [grafana/metrictank](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank)
 - **[Breaking][Code]** Migrate all internal structures to `github.com/go-graphite/protocol/carbonapi_v3_pb`. This removes redundant IsAbsent slice and changes all timestamps to int64 (they are still expected to have uint32 timestamps there)
 - **[Breaking][Improvement]** Migrate to carbonzipper 1.0.0. This introduces better loadbalancing support, but significantly changes config file format. It might behave differently with the same settings.
 - seriesByTag Support (thx. to Vladimir Kolobaev)
 - aliasByTag Support (thx. to Vladimir Kolobaev)
 - Supported functions were updated to be more compatible with graphtie-web 1.1.0+
 - Added support for more aggregation functions (thx. to Oleg Matrokhin)

**0.11.0**
 - **[Breaking][Fix] Allow to specify prefix for environment variables through `-envprefix` command line parameter. Default now is "CARBONAPI_" which might break some environments**
 - [Improvement] graphiteWeb function that implements force-fallback to graphtieWeb
 - [Improvement] graphiteWeb can query graphite-web 1.1.0+ for a list of supported functions and automatically do fallback to graphite in case user calls unimplemented function
 - [Improvement] New config switch to disable find request before render. This is helpful for graphite-clickhouse backends
 - [Fix] Fix typo in polyfit function description
 - [Fix] Skip metrics without pairs in reduceSeries (thx. to @errx)

 - [Code] Move MakeResponse to expr/types and rename it to MakeMetricData. This is sometimes useful outside of tests. Thx. to @borovskyav

**0.10.0.1**
 - [Fix] Autobuild scripts. Version bump to avoid retagging.

**0.10.0**
 - [Fix] `lineWidth` param is not working
 - [Fix] Support `&` in metric name
 - [Fix] default colors for png and svg are now defined as in graphite-web in 1.1.0, but add example of how to set them to new colors 
 - [Improvement] You can override default colors through config
 - [Improvement] It's now possible to specify 'template=' option to png or svg renders. It will use templates that's specified by 'graphTemplates' option in config. Template config format is not compatible with graphite-web though and uses either toml or yaml. Options naming is also different and follows URL override style.
 - [Code] Minor API changes in expr/png: MarshalPNGRequest and MarshalSVGRequest now requires to specify template.
 
**0.9.2**

Notes on upgrading:

Even though there are several changes that's marked as breaking, it only breaks local config parsing and changes logging format.

**This release fixes the incompatibility introduced in 0.6.0 and can work with both new and old versions of carbonserver, carbonzipper, go-carbon**

**0.7.0**
 - [Improvement] Render requests with globs now sent as-is.
 - [Improvement] Added ProxyHeaders handler to get real client's ip address from X-Real-IP or X-Forwarded-For headers.
 - [Improvement] Highest\* and Lowest\* now assumes '1' if no second argument was passed
 - [Feature] Implement legendValue expression (see http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.legendValue for more information)

Notes on upgrading to 0.7.0:

It's highly recommended, if you use carbonzipper to also upgrade it to version 0.62

**0.6.0**
 - **[Breaking]** Migrate to protobuf3

Notes on upgrading to 0.6.0:

You need to upgrade carbonzipper or go-carbon to the version that supports protobuf3

**<=0.5.0**
There is no dedicated changelog for older versions of carbonapi. Please see commit log for more information about what changed for each commit.
